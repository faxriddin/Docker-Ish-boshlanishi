[Qo'llanmani](https://docs.docker.com/windows/) o'zbek tilidagi tarjimasi.

Bu qo'llanma texnik bo'lmagan faqatgina Dockerni o'rganishga qiziqishi bo'lgan foydalanuvchilarga mo'ljallangan. Ushbu qo'llanmadan foydalanib siz Docker asoslarini ma'lum bir topshiriqlarni bajargan holatda o'rganasiz. You’ll learn how to:

    install Docker software using the Docker Toolbox
    use Docker Engine to run a software image in a container
    browse for an image on Docker Hub
    create your own image and run it in a container
    create a Docker Hub account and an image repository
    create an image of your own
    push your image to Docker Hub for others to use

The getting started was user tested to reduce the chance of users having problems. For the best chance of success, follow the steps as written the first time before exploring on your own. It takes approximately 45 minutes to complete.
Make sure you understand…

This getting started uses Docker Engine CLI commands entered on the commandline of a terminal window. You don’t need to be experienced using a command line, but you should be familiar with how to open one and type commands.
